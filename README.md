# 👋 Hello world! I’m Jeramiah

Here's a little bit of information about myself, so you can get to know me better:

- 😃 Nothing brings me more joy than spending time with my daughter, but I also like to spend my time:
    - Coding
    - Jeeping
    - Camping
    - Mountain Biking
    - Developing my skillsets
    - Listening to electronic music
    - Fantasizing about better ways Game of Thrones S8 could have ended...
- 🌱 Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at Western Governors University
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Machine Learning, and AI. I'm also intrigued by cool tech in general.
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate on any type of project! I always appreciate a chance to learn something new.
- 📫 Please reach out to me at jeramiahcoffey.dev@gmail.com
