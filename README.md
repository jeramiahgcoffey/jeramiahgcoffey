### 👋 Hello world, I’m @jeramiahgcoffey

- 😃 Nothings brings me more joy than spending time with my daughter, but I also like to spend my time:
    - Coding
    - Jeeping
    - Camping
    - Mountain Biking
    - Fantasizing about better ways Game of Thrones S8 could have ended...
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Machine Learning, AI, and learning new programming techniques.
